# Movie-Recommendation-System-using-Machine-Learning

Introduction:

This project aims to develop an efficient movie recommendation system. Utilizing advanced AI algorithms, this system suggests movies based on user preferences, improving the entertainment experience without the hassle of searching through vast options.

Problem Description:

The primary challenge is creating a recommendation system that accurately reflects diverse user tastes and preferences. This involves addressing issues related to data completeness, algorithm complexity, and user diversity.

Dataset Description:

The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains over 1,000,209 anonymous ratings of approximately 3,900 movies. It includes user demographics and movie details, providing a comprehensive foundation for our recommendation algorithms.

Algorithms:

We use Cosine Similarity, Matrix Factorization, and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze user-item interactions and generate personalized recommendations.

Simple Recommendation System:

Basic algorithm focusing on popularity-based and user-item interaction analysis.

Content-Based Recommendation System:

Analyzes item characteristics and user preferences to suggest similar content.

Hybrid Recommendation System:

Combines multiple recommendation approaches to enhance accuracy and user experience.
